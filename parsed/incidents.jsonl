GitHub takes measures to ensure that we have redundancy in our system for various disaster scenarios. We have been working on building redundancy to an earlier single point of failure in our network architecture at a second Internet edge facility. This second Internet edge facility was completed in January and has been actively routing production traffic since then. Today we were performing a live failover test to validate that we could in fact use this second Internet edge facility if the primary were to fail. Unfortunately, during this failover we inadvertently caused a production outage. During the test we exposed that the secondary site had a network pathing configuration issue that prevented it from properly functioning as the primary facility. This caused issues with Internet connectivity to GitHub, ultimately resulting in an outage. We were immediately notified of the issue in our monitoring and alerting. Within two minutes of being alerted we reverted the change and brought the primary facility back online. Once online it took time for traffic to be rebalanced and for our border routers to reconverge restoring public connectivity to affected GitHub systems. This failover test helped expose the configuration issue, and we are addressing the gaps in both configuration and our failover testing which will help make GitHub more resilient. We recognize the severity of this outage and apologize for the impact it has to our customers."}, {"at": "2023-06-29T18:36:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "We have recovered and are operating normally"}], "impact": "critical", "components": ["Git Operations", "Webhooks", "API Requests", "Issues", "Pull Requests", "Actions", "Packages", "Pages", "Codespaces", "Copilot"]}

This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data. This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures. During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoints. We mitigated this through improvements to our rate limiting and changes to get to a healthy state across our backend service and cache . We initially relied on automated communication messages during this incident and will be working to ensure future incidents have more relevant status updates with specific customer impact."}], "impact": "minor", "components": ["Git Operations", "Actions"]}

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows. We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC.

The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online. We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.

This delay averaged between 5 and 10 minutes and affected up to 30% of pull request page views during the incident. 1% of pull request page views experienced delays of up to 60 minutes.

As follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines."}], "impact": "minor", "components": ["Webhooks", "Actions"]}

During this time customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences. This system plays a crucial role in managing email subscriptions and the contactability of GitHub customers by our marketing and sales teams. Unfortunately, the outage prevented the generation of links for managing email subscriptions, resulting in the `/settings/emails` page timing out. Consequently, customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences during this period. During the incident we implemented graceful degradation on the `/settings/email` page to enable certain functionality, albeit with slower response times. By approximately 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our contact permissions system was fully operational again, and customers could manage their email subscription preferences as usual. With the issue now resolved, our team is enhancing the `/settings/emails` page resilience to minimize the impact of system outages in the future. This includes better request timeout handling and improved metrics and monitoring in this area of the application."}, {"at": "2024-01-03T17:05:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved."}], "impact": "minor"}

This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site. An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet. A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site. These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in connection establishment events that led to the online proxy hosts hitting the connection limit. Upon further analysis, that limit was lower than it should have been. We have increased that limit to prevent this from recurring.

This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites. The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality. For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests. We have so far identified three remediation items here: - Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses. - Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists. - Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future."}], "impact": "major"}

The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC.

While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services.

We mitigated the incident by shipping a fix to handle the edge case gracefully and allow processing to continue. Once the fix was deployed at 1:47 UTC, our systems fully caught up with pending background jobs at 1:58 UTC.

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner."}, {"at": "2024-04-14T21:53:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved."}], "impact": "major"}

We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged. At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20. Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.

Approximately 25% of all runs targeting larger hosted runners queued during this time were slow to start, with a median wait time of 1 minute, 55 seconds. The issue was caused by a downstream dependency overloading, which impacted our machine setup process. Each larger hosted runner job is run on a fresh VM, and one of the setup steps is installing the Actions agent. Up to the point of this incident, we would pull the latest agent version from the GitHub release and install it on the VM. However, during this incident the speciific GitHub release for the Linux x64 Actions agent became overloaded, and our agent downloads were severely throttled. This throttling led to timeouts during the download, and caused our hosted runner system to conclude the VMs were failing to start. We need the Actions agent online to start serving jobs, and with the download timing out, our service assumed the runner wasn't starting up successfully. This failure to start up led to those VMs being reset again and again instead of serving jobs. We mitigated the issue by falling back to a cached version of the Actions agent present on our image. We have further refined the fallback system to automatically use the cached agent binaries, and added new functionality to allow for easier agent downloading from other locations. Both of these measures should eliminate future impacts from similar downstream impact."}, {"at": "2024-05-14T21:04:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved."}], "impact": "minor", "components": ["Actions"], "components_source": "gliner2", "components_confidence": {"Actions": 0.9055570960044861}}

We mitigated the impact to Pull Requests and Actions at 19:32 UTC by pausing all Organization membership update jobs. We deployed a code change at 22:30 UTC to skip over the jobs queued by the backend change and re-enabled Organization membership update jobs. We restored the Organization membership update functionality at 22:52 UTC, including all membership changes queued during the incident. During the incident, about 15% of Action workflow runs experienced a delay of more than five minutes. In addition, Pull Requests had delays in determining merge eligibility and starting associated Action workflows for the duration of the incident. Organization membership updates saw delays for upwards of five hours.

At 22:59 UTC an erroneous configuration change rolled out to all GitHub.com databases that impacted the ability of the database to respond to health check pings from the routing service. As a result, the routing service could not detect healthy databases to route application traffic to. This led to widespread impact on GitHub.com starting at 23:02 UTC.

The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers. We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated. We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.

On average, 26% of jobs requiring large runners had a >5min delay getting a runner assigned. This was caused by the rollback of a configuration change and a latent bug in event processing, which was triggered by the mixed data shape that resulted from the rollback. The processing would reprocess the same events unnecessarily and cause the background job that manages large runner creation and deletion to run out of resources. It would automatically restart and continue processing, but the jobs were not able to keep up with production traffic. We mitigated the impact by using a feature flag to bypass the problematic event processing logic. While these changes had been rolling out in stages over the last few months and had been safely rolled back previously, an unrelated change prevented rollback from causing this problem in earlier stages. We are reviewing and updating the feature flags in this event processing workflow to ensure that we have high confidence in rollback in all rollout stages.

During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.

After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident. This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel.

On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic. We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests.

This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery. The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state. To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process."}, {"at": "2025-09-15T18:28:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved.

Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19. The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.

To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests.

Re-run of failed workflows had a high chance of succeeding given the limited rollout of the change. The job failures were mitigated by rolling back the affected configuration and removing the provisioned runners that had this configuration.

Impact was concentrated among users and integrations actively using Copilot Coding Agent with VS Code. The degradation was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic to the related API endpoints that exceeded an internal secondary rate limit. That resulted in upstream request denials which were surfaced to users as elevated 500 errors. We mitigated the incident by deploying a change that increased the applicable rate limit for this traffic, which allowed requests to complete successfully and returned the service to normal operation.

The first period occurred between 16:12 UTC and 17:39 UTC, and the second between 18:53 UTC and 20:09 UTC. In total, users experienced approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes of degraded service across the two incidents. During both incidents, users encountered errors loading pages on GitHub.com, failures when pushing or pulling code over HTTPS, failures starting or completing GitHub Actions workflow runs, and errors using GitHub Copilot. Additional services including GitHub Issues, pull requests, webhooks, Dependabot, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Codespaces experienced intermittent errors. SSH-based Git operations were not affected during either incident. Our investigation determined that both incidents shared the same underlying cause: a configuration change to a user settings caching mechanism caused a large volume of cache rewrites to occur simultaneously. During the first incident, asynchronous rewrites overwhelmed a shared infrastructure component responsible for coordinating background work, triggering cascading failures. Increased load caused the service responsible for proxying Git operations over HTTPS to exhaust available connections, preventing it from accepting new requests. We mitigated this incident by disabling async cache rewrites and restarting the affected Git proxy service across multiple datacenters. An additional source of updates to the same cache circumvented our initial mitigations and caused the second incident. This generated a high volume of synchronous writes, causing replication delays that cascaded in a similar pattern and again exhausted the Git proxy\u2019s connection capacity, degrading availability across multiple services. We mitigated by disabling the source of the cache rewrites and again restarting Git proxy. We know these incidents disrupted the workflows of millions of developers. While we have made substantial, long-term investments in how GitHub is built and operated to improve resilience, GitHub's availability is not yet meeting our expectations. Getting there requires deep architectural work that is already underway, as well as urgent, targeted improvements. We are taking the following immediate steps: 1. We have already optimized the caching mechanism to avoid write amplification and added self-throttling during bulk updates. 2. We are adding safeguards to ensure the caching mechanism responds more quickly to rollbacks and strengthening how changes to these caching systems are planned, validated, and rolled out with additional checks. 3. We are fixing the underlying cause of connection exhaustion in our Git HTTPS proxy layer so the proxy can recover from this failure mode automatically without requiring manual restarts. GitHub is critical infrastructure for your work, your teams, and your businesses. We're focusing on these mitigations and long-term infrastructure work so GitHub is available, at scale, when and where you need it."}, {"at": "2026-02-09T17:40:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved.

The first period occurred between 16:12 UTC and 17:39 UTC, and the second between 18:53 UTC and 20:09 UTC. In total, users experienced approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes of degraded service across the two incidents. During both incidents, users encountered errors loading pages on GitHub.com, failures when pushing or pulling code over HTTPS, failures starting or completing GitHub Actions workflow runs, and errors using GitHub Copilot. Additional services including GitHub Issues, pull requests, webhooks, Dependabot, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Codespaces experienced intermittent errors. SSH-based Git operations were not affected during either incident. Our investigation determined that both incidents shared the same underlying cause: a configuration change to a user settings caching mechanism caused a large volume of cache rewrites to occur simultaneously. During the first incident, asynchronous rewrites overwhelmed a shared infrastructure component responsible for coordinating background work, triggering cascading failures. Increased load caused the service responsible for proxying Git operations over HTTPS to exhaust available connections, preventing it from accepting new requests. We mitigated this incident by disabling async cache rewrites and restarting the affected Git proxy service across multiple datacenters. An additional source of updates to the same cache circumvented our initial mitigations and caused the second incident. This generated a high volume of synchronous writes, causing replication delays that cascaded in a similar pattern and again exhausted the Git proxy\u2019s connection capacity, degrading availability across multiple services. We mitigated by disabling the source of the cache rewrites and again restarting Git proxy. We know these incidents disrupted the workflows of millions of developers. While we have made substantial, long-term investments in how GitHub is built and operated to improve resilience, GitHub's availability is not yet meeting our expectations. Getting there requires deep architectural work that is already underway, as well as urgent, targeted improvements. We are taking the following immediate steps: 1. We have already optimized the caching mechanism to avoid write amplification and added self-throttling during bulk updates. 2. We are adding safeguards to ensure the caching mechanism responds more quickly to rollbacks and strengthening how changes to these caching systems are planned, validated, and rolled out with additional checks. 3. We are fixing the underlying cause of connection exhaustion in our Git HTTPS proxy layer so the proxy can recover from this failure mode automatically without requiring manual restarts. GitHub is critical infrastructure for your work, your teams, and your businesses. We're focusing on these mitigations and long-term infrastructure work so GitHub is available, at scale, when and where you need it."}, {"at": "2026-02-09T20:09:00Z", "status": "Resolved", "message": "This incident has been resolved.
